##Q1:
A: The value for variable a is used on this line. Because we called the function with address of variable 	a(parameter).
B: The incval function in main.c is a declaration and the incval function in func.c is a definition.
C: The second printed result is wrong.
	The correct answer is a:2.0
D: We use link technique.

##Q2:
A:
	1: memory address is 0x0055bac8dff299, #2
	2: memory address is 0x0055bac8e02080, #5,#6
	3: memory address is 0x0055bac8e040c0, #6
	4: memory address is 0x0055bac8dff2C2, #2~#6
	5: memory address is 0x007ffc7a78dfd8, #20
B:	They are very close. Because blerg variable is declared first in main function.
C:	They are very close. Because the variable whoa is declared after variable whoa.

Q3-answer:
	The memory addresses associated with variables aren't determined until after the program is compiled and running on the computer.
So we canâ€™t control the address of values on code.
