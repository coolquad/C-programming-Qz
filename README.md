# C-programming-Qz

####Q1:
A: The value for variable a is used on this line. Because we called the function with address of variable 	a(parameter).
B: The incval function in main.c is a declaration and the incval function in func.c is a definition.
C: The second printed result is wrong.
	The correct answer is a:2.0
D: We use link technique.

####Q2:
A:
	1: memory address is 0x0055bac8dff299, #2
	2: memory address is 0x0055bac8e02080, #5,#6
	3: memory address is 0x0055bac8e040c0, #6
	4: memory address is 0x0055bac8dff2C2, #2~#6
	5: memory address is 0x007ffc7a78dfd8, #20
B:	They are very close. Because blerg variable is declared first in main function.
C:	They are very close. Because the variable whoa is declared after variable whoa.

####Q3-answer:
	The memory addresses associated with variables aren't determined until after the program is compiled and running on the computer.
So we canâ€™t control the address of values on code.

####Q4
The chunking is a process by which individual pieces of an information set are broken down and then grouped together in a meaningful whole, so The chunks by which the information is grouped is meant to improve short-term retention of the material, thus bypassing and seperating  the limited capacity of working memory
A
If you want to see your cached memory of your processor . then you have to go to the BIOS Setup . which is normally F10 in most of the computers . or may be F4 or F12.
you have to press the key on start-up of your computer. then you have to go on system information.
SO THE PROCESS IS THE FOLLOWING :
1. press the start button of your CPU . or just restart you computer.
2. press f10 (for hp) and f9 , f12 for others. press key for 2 to 3 times.
3.then go to the system information. and press enter . (note that: your mouse will not work in bios menu .)
B
Virtual addresses are used by the operating system to access kernel and user memory. The CPU manages translation of virtual to physical addresses using its Memory Management Unit (MMU). A virtual address is specified as a offset from the start of a memory segment; these segments are used by the kernel and user processes to hold their text, stack, data, and other regions.
step 1
0x000039A is in virtual, lets convert it to binary representation
0b 0000 0000 0000 0000 0011 1001 1010
0x   0    0    0    0    3    9    A
step2
Calculate the number of bits needed to reference the whole 1KB
1K = 2^10
==> 10 bits are needed. Just do log2(page-size).
step3
Take away the first 10 bits of the binary presentation
0b 0000 0000 0000 0000 0011 1001 1010
offset = 0b 11 1001 1010
       = 0x  3   9    A 
step4 
Get the virtual page out of what ever bits left
0b (00)(00 00)(00 00)(00 00)(00 00)
=  0x00000
step5 
Go to the page table at the entry 0x00000, there you will find the corresponding frame number.
Suppose the page table is given: 
________________
| 0x0 | 0x0100 |
| 0x1 | 0xA    |
|  .  |        |
|  .  |        |
|     |        |
----------------
step6
Turn the frame number to binary representation and concatenate it to the offset
Frame                           |      offset
0x0100                          |
0b (00)(00 00)(01 00)(00 00)(00 | 11) (1001) (1010)
0x 004039A


####Q5
#include "idnm.h"
int main(int argc,  char *argv[]){
	//(A)
	if(argc<2) {
		cout<<"arguments are invalid!"<<endl;
		return -1;
	//(B)
	int search_id=atoi(argv[1]);
	//set up for memory mapped file
	int fd=fopen(filename, O_RDONLY)
	struct stat stat_buf;
	fstat(fd, &stat_buf)
	int size=stat_buf.st_size;
	//(C)
	void *file_bytes=stat_buf.address
	//(D)
	fhead_t *fhead=(fhead_t*)malloc(sizeof(fhead_t));
	//(E)
	idmn_t *idmn_sec=(idmn_t*)malloc(sizeof(idmn_t));
	char *nm_sec=fhead.nm_sec_off;
	//(F)
	char *name=fhead->nm_off;
	//(G)
	if(fhead->id==i){
		 printf("%x\n",*fhead->id);
		 printf("%s\n",*fhead->name);	
	}
}
